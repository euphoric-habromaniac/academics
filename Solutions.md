## Henry's Law

Henry's law is one of the gas laws formulated by William Henry in 1803 and states: 

> "At a constant temperature, the amount of a given gas that dissolves in a given type and volume of liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of that gas in equilibrium with that liquid." 

An equivalent way of stating the law is that the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas above the liquid:

$$C=k_HP_{gas}$$
## Rault's Law
- the vapor pressure of a solvent above a solution is _equal_ to the vapor pressure of the pure solvent at the same temperature _scaled_ by the mole fraction of the solvent present:
- vapour pressure of a solution is lower than that of the pure solvent.
$$P_{solution} = \chi_{solvent}P^o_{solvent}$$

###  Ideal vs Real
- hexane-heptane mixture is near ideal.
- considering $\chi_{hexane} = 1 – \chi_{heptane}$

#### Negative Deviations
- intermolecular attractions (A-B) are greater than intramolecular attraction (A-A) (B-B)
- for eg. chloroform-acetone mixture has hydrogen bonding between each other hence the total vapour pressure in their mixture is lower than the sum.

Examples
- HCl and water
- chloroform and acetone
- HNO3 and water
- acetic acid and pyridine
- water and HI
- Water and HClO4

#### Positive Deviations
- Intramolecular forces of attraction are greater than intermolecular.
- most probable in unlike compounds, like Benzene and Carbon Disulfide (CS2)
Examples
- Acetone and CS2
- Acetone and Benzene
- Ethyl Alcohol and Water??
- CCl4 and CHCl3

## Colligative Properties
1. osmotic pressure
$$\pi = i M RT$$
2. depression of freezing point
$$\Delta{T_f} = -i K_f m$$
3. elevation of boiling point
$$\Delta{T_f} = i K_b m$$
4. lowering of vapour pressure
$$P_{solution} = \chi_{solvent}P^o_{solvent}$$
## Constants
1. Ebullioscopic Constant
$$ K_b = \frac{RMT_b^2}{1000\Delta H_{vap}}$$
2. Cryoscopic Constant
$$ K_f = \frac{RMT_f^2}{1000\Delta H_{fus}}$$

- $R$ is the [ideal gas constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_gas_constant "Ideal gas constant").
- $M$ is the [molar mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_mass "Molar mass") of the solvent.
- $T_f$ is the [freezing point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freezing_point "Freezing point") of the pure solvent in [kelvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin "Kelvin").
- $\Delta H_{fus}$ is the molar [enthalpy of fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enthalpy_of_fusion "Enthalpy of fusion") of the solvent.


# Van't Hoff Factor
first principles method to calculate association -- similar to ostwald's law of dilution

### Association
$$ i = (1 - \alpha) + \frac{\alpha}{n}$$
## Dissassociation
$$ i = 1 + (n-1)\alpha$$
