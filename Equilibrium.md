# Law of Mass Action

$$K= \frac {[A']^{\alpha '} [B']^{\beta '}\ldots} {[A]^\alpha [B]^\beta \ldots}$$

the rate of a chemical reaction is directly proportional to the product of the activities or concentrations of the reactants.

### Equilibrium Constant
- equilibrium constant in terms of concentration

$$K_c= \frac {[A']^{\alpha '} [B']^{\beta '}\ldots} {[A]^\alpha [B]^\beta \ldots}$$

- equilibrium constant in terms of partial pressure

$$K_p = \frac{P_C^c P_D^d}{P_A^a P_B^b}$$

- the pressure equilibrium constant and the concentration constant are related by:
  
$$K_p = K_c (RT)^{\Delta n_g}$$

# Common Ion Effect

# Van't Hoff Equation
### Gibbs Free Energy
- non standard gibbs free energy
$$ \Delta G = \Delta G\degree + RT\ln Q$$
- gibbs free energy according to equilibrium (standard)
$$\Delta G\degree = -RT\ln k$$
- standard gibbs free energy
$$\Delta G\degree = \Delta H\degree - T \Delta S\degree$$
- van't hoff equation (derived from the above two)
$$\ln {k_1 \over k_2} = {\Delta H\degree \over R}({1 \over T_2} - {1 \over T1})$$

# Oswald's Dilution Law
$$AB \to A^+ (aq) + B^- (aq)$$

| $AB$          | $A^+$     | $B^-$     |
| ------------- | --------- | --------- |
| $C$           | $0$       | $0$       |
| $C(1-\alpha)$ | $C\alpha$ | $C\alpha$ |

for reasonably strong electrolyte

$$k = {[A^+][B^-] \over [AB]} = {C\alpha^2 \over1-\alpha}$$

for weak electrolytes: $1- \alpha \approx 1$

$$k = {[A^+][B^-] \over [AB]} = {C\alpha^2}$$

# pH and pKa and pKb
- the regular stuff and definitions

$$pH = -\log[H^+] = -\log[H_3O^+]$$
$$ k_a = {[H^+][A^-] \over [HA]}$$
$$ k_b = {[B^+][OH^-] \over [BOH]}$$
$$ k_w = {[H^+][OH^-]}$$
- $k_w$ is the autoionization constant 
- the pKa and pKb similarly mean the negative of the logs of ka and kb.
- in any solution of water 
$$pK_a + pK_b = pK_w$$
where the constants $k_a$ and $k_b$ are defined for the conjugate pairs of acids/bases.

- k_w will always be the same for a specific temperature

# Buffer
solution of conjugates is formed when ionized so the pH can be maintained as any new weak acid/base added will react with the conjugates.

- Henderson-Hasselbach Equation
$$pH = pK_a + \log{[\text{salt}]\over [\text{acid}]}$$
$$pH = pK_b + \log{[\text{salt}]\over [\text{base}]}$$
# Solubility Product
for a salt $CA \to C^+ + A^-$ 
$$K_sp = [C^+][A^-]$$

# Titration

# Footnotes
[The fact that equilibrium constants are unitless quantities is indisputable](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpclett.2c00314#:~:text=The%20fact%20that%20equilibrium%20constants%20are%20unitless%20quantities%20is%20indisputable)
something about fugacity that declares that $[A]^a$ actually means some activity rather than concentration.
